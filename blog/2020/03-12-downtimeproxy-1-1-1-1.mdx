## End distribution of exe and distribute with python file

Thanks to all those who wrote the review.

As mentioned in the review, my distributed exe was diagnosed by some security software as a possible virus.

So I decided to delete the exe and distribute it as a python file.

If you use this, you need Python 2.7 or Python 3. Then install the Python library Quarry. Ask questions or ask on GitHub. Support as much as possible.
